Alright. Here’s a **clean, judge-ready, hackathon-appropriate PRD** for your product.
This is written exactly the way evaluators, mentors, and future teammates expect it to be written.

# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **Product Name:** NeuroLearn

## **Category:** AI-Powered Adaptive Learning Platform

## **Context:** Hackathon Prototype (Simulated AI, Rule-Based Intelligence)

---

## **1. Product Vision**

NeuroLearn is an **AI-powered, memory-aware learning platform** designed to simulate intelligent, personalized education.
It focuses not only on *what* learners answer, but *how* they think, hesitate, revise, and remember over time.

The platform demonstrates:

* Thinking-first assessment
* Personalized roadmaps
* Memory-aware revision planning
* Ethical, integrity-driven learning progression

All intelligence is **simulated or rule-based**, making it feasible within a hackathon environment while still demonstrating strong AI concepts.

---

## **2. Goals & Objectives**

### Primary Goals

* Simulate **adaptive learning behavior**
* Personalize **roadmaps, content, and progression**
* Track **cognitive and behavioral signals**
* Demonstrate **memory-aware revision logic**

### Non-Goals (Hackathon Scope)

* No heavy ML model training
* No real-time recommendation retraining
* No external LMS integrations

---

## **3. Target Users**

* College students
* Early professionals
* Self-learners preparing for technical domains

---

## **4. Core Problems Addressed**

* One-size-fits-all learning paths ignore user diversity
* Traditional quizzes test recall, not understanding
* Learners progress without mastering fundamentals
* No system tracks forgetting or revision urgency

---

## **5. Authentication & User Identity**

### Requirements

* OAuth-based authentication
* On first login, assign a **unique, static User ID**
* User ID must persist across sessions

### Purpose

The User ID is used to:

* Track learning progress
* Store analytics
* Maintain revision history
* Personalize future learning paths

---

## **6. AI-Driven Onboarding & Intent Capture**

### Flow

1. User logs in for the first time
2. System simulates an AI onboarding interaction
3. User selects a learning domain

### Supported Domains (Static for Hackathon)

* Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
* Web Development
* AI / Machine Learning

The selected domain is stored against the User ID.

---

## **7. Skill-Level Classification (New Feature)**

When a user clicks a domain:

### Skill Level Popup

User must choose:

* Beginner
* Intermediate
* Advanced

#### Beginner Path

* No assumptions about prior knowledge
* Assign a **fixed, standard roadmap**
* Minimal intelligence applied

#### Intermediate / Advanced Path

* Trigger a **standardized diagnostic quiz**
* Quiz evaluates both knowledge and behavior

---

## **8. Diagnostic Quiz & Behavioral Analytics**

### Captured Metrics

* Accuracy
* Time per question
* Total time taken
* Option switching behavior (A → B → A)
* Number of clicks per question
* Concept mapped per question

### Output

* AI-generated **proficiency score**
* Concept-wise strength and weakness profile

> AI may be simulated using rule-based logic or prompt-driven GenAI.

All diagnostic data is sent to the backend as a structured document.

---

## **9. Personalized Roadmap Generation**

### Logic

* Roadmaps are **static in structure**
* Personalization occurs in:

  * Content depth
  * Module emphasis
  * Learning format (video/text/mixed)

### Example (DSA)

* Arrays
* Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues

Each topic expands into:

* Video lectures (e.g., YouTube)
* Text modules
* TL;DR summaries for all content types

Different users selecting the same domain may receive **different roadmaps**.

---

## **10. Course & Module Structure**

### Hierarchy

* Subject
  → Courses
  → Modules (exactly 5 per course)

### Each Module Includes

1. TL;DR summary
2. Learning content (video/text/mixed)
3. Micro quiz (mandatory)

---

## **11. Micro Quiz & AI Integrity Checker**

### Quiz Characteristics

* Full-screen / focus mode
* Visible timer
* No skipping
* Mandatory submission

### Captured Signals

* Time spent reading
* Time to answer
* Accuracy
* Option switching
* User intuition text:

  > “Why did you choose this answer?”

### AI Evaluation

* Generates a **true knowledge score**
* Distinguishes guessing vs understanding
* Breaks module concepts into:

  * Strong concepts
  * Weak concepts

Example:

> Module has 10 concepts → User weak in 3 concepts

---

## **12. AI-Driven Progression Logic**

### If User Passes

* Module marked as completed
* Next module unlocked

### If User Fails

* Next module remains locked
* System recommends:

  * Revision
  * Alternative explanations
  * Different content format

Only **cleared modules unlock progression**.

---

## **13. Targeted Re-Teaching System**

* Users are re-taught **only weak concepts**
* No full module repetition unless required
* Alternative explanations or formats may be used

This ensures:

* Efficiency
* Reduced frustration
* Better retention

---

## **14. Analytics Storage**

### Storage Format

* JSON documents

* Scores & time spent
* Strong vs weak concepts
* Learning progression

Visualizations help users:

* Understand learning gaps
* Track improvement

* “Revise right now!”
* “Should be revised in 1–2 days”
* “Can be revised later (within a week)”

Displayed clearly alongside each module.
