#  NeuroLearn - The AI-Powered Adaptive Learning Platform

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

NeuroLearn is a next-generation adaptive learning platform that creates personalized educational roadmaps based on your unique knowledge profile. It leverages AI for content generation, in-depth behavioral analysis to understand your learning patterns, and an event-driven analytics engine for real-time progress tracking and spaced repetition.

---



## About The Project

Traditional learning platforms often follow a one-size-fits-all approach. NeuroLearn breaks that mold by building a dynamic learning journey tailored to you.

It starts with a **diagnostic quiz** to assess your current proficiency and identify your specific strengths and weaknesses. Based on this, our **AI-powered backend** generates a personalized roadmap of learning modules. As you progress, the system analyzes not just your answers, but *how* you answer—tracking confidence, hesitation, and time management to build a comprehensive behavioral profile.

Behind the scenes, an **event-driven analytics pipeline** captures every interaction, feeding real-time dashboards and powering a **spaced repetition engine** based on the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve to recommend what to revise and when.

This project was built with a modern, decoupled architecture, making it scalable, resilient, and ready for future innovation.

```
- **Client**: The user-facing React application.
- **Supabase (PostgreSQL)**: Acts as the primary database for user authentication, profiles, and core application data.
- **FastAPI AI Backend**: The "brain" of the platform. It handles quiz submissions, performs behavioral analysis, and communicates with Google Gemini to generate personalized roadmaps and learning content.
- **API Gateway & Kafka**: The frontend sends analytics events (e.g., `module_quiz_events`) to a Node.js gateway, which publishes them to Kafka topics.
- **TypeScript Consumers**: These services listen to Kafka topics to process events in real-time. The `analyticsConsumer` aggregates metrics, while the `memoryScoreConsumer` calculates spaced repetition intervals.
- **MongoDB**: Serves as the analytics database, storing event data and aggregations for querying by Grafana.
- **Grafana**: Provides real-time visualization dashboards for user analytics and system monitoring.

##  Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the complete NeuroLearn platform locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v18 or higher)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.9 or higher)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and Docker Compose

### 1. Infrastructure Setup

The `docker-compose.yml` file starts all the necessary backing services (Kafka, MongoDB, Grafana, etc.).

```bash
# Navigate to the neurolearn project root
cd neurolearn

# Start all services in detached mode
docker-compose up -d
```

Your infrastructure is now running. You can access the management UIs here:
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
- **Kafka UI**: http://localhost:8081
- **Mongo Express**: http://localhost:8085

### 2. Backend Setup (Python AI Service)

This service handles AI-powered content generation and quiz analysis.

```bash
# Navigate to the Python backend directory
cd backend-python

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your keys (e.g., GEMINI_API_KEY)
# nano .env or code .env

# Start the server (with auto-reload)
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
The AI backend is now running at **http://localhost:8000**.

### 3. Frontend Setup (React Client)

This is the main web application you will interact with.

```bash
# Navigate to the client directory
cd client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your Supabase keys
# nano .env or code .env

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
The NeuroLearn web app is now accessible at **http://localhost:8080**.

*Note: Instructions for the Node.js analytics service are pending and will be added soon.*
