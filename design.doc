*(Multi-Domain, AI-Driven Learning Platform)*

---

## **1. Design Philosophy**

NeuroLearn’s UI must communicate **intelligence, trust, and focus**.

Core principles:

* **System-first design** (domains are data, AI is the core)
* **Distraction-free learning**
* **Visual clarity over decoration**
* **Explainable intelligence** (users should see *why* something is recommended)

The design should feel:

> *“This platform understands how I think.”*

---

## **2. Supported Domains (Scalable UI)**

The UI must natively support **multiple technical domains** without redesign.

### Domains Displayed

* DSA
* Web Development
* AI / ML
* Cloud
* DevOps
* OOPS
* Computer Networks (CN)

⚠️ Important:
UI treats **all domains equally**, even if backend depth differs.

---

## **3. Global Layout System**

### **A. Persistent Sidebar (Desktop)**

* Logo + “NeuroLearn”
* Navigation:

  * Home
  * My Roadmap
  * Analytics
  * Revision Planner
  * Profile

Minimal icons + text (inspired by Dribbble).

---

### **B. Main Content Area**

* Card-based layout
* Large whitespace
* Sectioned hierarchy

---

### **C. Responsive Rules**

* Mobile:

  * Collapsible sidebar
  * Full-screen quizzes
  * Sticky CTAs
* Desktop:

  * Grid dashboards
  * Side-by-side analytics

---

## **4. Landing Page — Domain Selection**

### UI Structure

* Grid of **Domain Cards**
* Each card shows:

  * Domain name
  * Short 1-line description
  * Progress indicator (if already started)

Example:

```
[ DSA ]        [ Web Dev ]
[ AI / ML ]    [ Cloud ]
[ DevOps ]     [ OOPS ]
[ CN ]
```

### Interaction

* Clicking a domain → **Skill Level Popup**

---

## **5. Skill Level Popup (Critical UX Element)**

Modal overlay (centered, soft blur background).

### Options

* Beginner
* Intermediate
* Advanced

### Design Intent

* Calm, non-judgmental tone
* No “test anxiety” visuals

### Behavior

* Beginner → Direct roadmap
* Intermediate / Advanced → Diagnostic quiz

This popup is **identical across all domains**.

---

## **6. Diagnostic Quiz UI (Pre-Roadmap Intelligence)**

### Design Mode

* Full focus layout
* One question per screen
* Minimal navigation

### Visible Elements

* Question
* Options (large, clickable)
* Subtle timer
* Progress indicator (Q2 of 8)

### Invisible (but tracked)

* Time per question
* Option switching
* Click count
* Concept tag

> UI should *not* expose tracking — only feel smooth.

---

## **7. Personalized Roadmap Screen**

### Visual Style

* Vertical or horizontal roadmap
* Node-based progression
* Clear lock/unlock states

### Node States

* 🔒 Locked (greyed)
* ▶ Available (accent color)
* ✅ Completed (soft success color)

### Each Node Shows

* Module title
* Estimated time
* Content type badge (Video / Text / Mixed)

This roadmap adapts per:

* Skill level
* Diagnostic score
* AI recommendation

---

## **8. Module Learning Screen**

### Header

* Module title
* Progress bar (within course)
* Module status

### Content Area

* Video embed **or**
* Text explanation
* Expandable **TL;DR panel** (always present)

### Design Rule

TL;DR must be:

* Visually lighter
* Always accessible
* Never hidden behind tabs

---

## **9. Micro Quiz Interface (Integrity-Critical)**

### Mode

* Full-tab takeover
* No sidebar
* No distractions

### Layout

* Question (large, centered)
* Options (stacked)
* Timer (top-right)
* “Why did you choose this?” text box

### UX Intent

* Encourage **reflection**, not speed
* Text box feels conversational, not exam-like

---

## **10. AI Integrity Feedback Screen**

After quiz submission:

### Show:

* Score (softly presented)
* Strengths
* Weak concepts (bullet-level)

Example:

> “You’re strong in 7 concepts.
> Let’s revisit 3 specific ones.”

### Design Rule

* No red “fail” screens
* No harsh language
* Supportive tone

---

## **11. Locked Progression UX**

* Next module button:

  * Disabled until cleared
* Clear visual explanation:

  > “Complete this module to unlock the next one.”

This reinforces **mastery-based learning**.

---

## **12. Analytics Dashboard**

### Sections

1. Progress Overview
2. Time vs Accuracy
3. Concept Mastery
4. Domain-wise performance

### Visualization Style

* Minimal charts
* Soft colors
* No data overload

Judges should understand it **in 5 seconds**.

---

## **13. Revision Planner UI**

### Module Cards Show:

* Module name
* Revision urgency label
* Last studied timestamp

### Urgency Color Codes

* 🔴 Revise now
* 🟡 Revise soon
* 🟢 Can revise later

Clear, glanceable, actionable.

## **14. Design Consistency Rules**

| Element    | Rule                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Cards      | Rounded, soft shadows    |
| Buttons    | Clear primary/secondary  |
| Animations | Subtle, purposeful       |
| Fonts      | Clean sans-serif         |
| Colors     | Accents only for meaning |

---

## **15. Why This Design Works for 7 Domains**

* Domains are **data-driven**, not UI-driven
* Same UX flow works for:

  * DSA logic
  * CN theory
  * DevOps concepts
* Only content + analytics change

This proves **scalability**, not just polish.

---

## **16. Hackathon-Ready Justification (Use This Line)**

> “We designed NeuroLearn as a domain-agnostic learning system. The UI remains constant while AI-driven intelligence adapts learning paths across DSA, WebDev, AI/ML, Cloud, DevOps, OOPS, and CN.”

That sentence alone wins points.
