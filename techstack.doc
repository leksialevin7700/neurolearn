# **Technology Stack Document (techstack.doc)**

## **Product:** NeuroLearn

**Category:** AI-Powered Adaptive Learning Platform
**Scope:** Hackathon Prototype (Rule-Based & Simulated AI)

---

## **1. Tech Stack Philosophy**

The NeuroLearn tech stack is designed to:

* Be **hackathon-feasible (24-hour build)**
* Demonstrate **AI-first system design** without heavy ML
* Support **scalability, explainability, and modularity**
* Separate **learning logic, analytics, and UI concerns**

> The goal is not heavy computation, but **intelligent system behavior**.

---

## **2. High-Level Architecture Overview**

**Client (UI)**
→ **API Layer**
→ **Learning Intelligence Engine (Simulated AI)**
→ **Analytics & Storage**

Authentication, analytics, and learning decisions are cleanly decoupled.

---

## **3. Frontend Stack**

---

## **4. Backend Stack**

### **Primary Backend**

* **Python (FastAPI)**

  * High-performance async backend
  * Clean API schema with automatic docs (Swagger)
  * Easy rule-based AI logic implementation

* **Uvicorn**

  * ASGI server for FastAPI
  * Lightweight and fast for hackathon deployment

---

### **Backend Responsibilities**

* User session handling
* Domain & roadmap orchestration
* Quiz submission processing
* Behavioral analytics ingestion
* Rule-based AI decision logic
* Revision urgency computation

---

### **Backend Responsibilities**

* User session handling
* Domain & roadmap orchestration
* Quiz submission processing
* Behavioral analytics ingestion
* Rule-based AI decision logic
* Revision urgency computation

---

## **5. Authentication & Identity Management**

* **Supabase Auth**

  * OAuth-based login (Google / Email)
  * Secure session handling

### **Identity Model**

* Each user assigned a **static User ID** on first login
* User ID persists across sessions
* Used as primary key across:

  * Analytics
  * Roadmaps
  * Revision history

---

## **6. Database & Storage Layer**

### **Primary Database**

* **MongoDB (Atlas)**

### **Why MongoDB?**

* Schema-flexible for evolving analytics
* Ideal for JSON-based behavioral data
* Fast iteration during hackathons
* Easy horizontal scalability

---

### **Data Storage Strategy**

**Collections:**

* Users
* Domains
* Courses
* Modules
* Analytics
* RevisionPlans

**Document-Based Storage:**

* Diagnostic quiz analytics
* Micro quiz behavior signals
* Concept-wise mastery data
* Revision recommendation metadata

---

### **Data Storage Strategy**

**Structured Tables:**

* Users
* Domains
* Courses
* Modules

**JSON-Based Documents:**

* Diagnostic quiz analytics
* Micro quiz behavior signals
* Concept-wise mastery data
* Revision recommendation metadata

---

## **7. AI & Intelligence Layer (Simulated)**

### **Approach**

No heavy ML training. Intelligence is demonstrated through:

* Rule-based logic
* Prompt-driven GenAI (optional)
* Agent-style decision simulation

---

### **AI Capabilities Implemented**

* Skill classification logic
* Proficiency score calculation
* Guessing vs understanding detection
* Weak vs strong concept identification
* Personalized roadmap adaptation
* Memory-aware revision labeling

> All decisions are **explainable and deterministic**, ideal for hackathon judging.

---

## **8. Analytics & Behavioral Tracking**

### **Captured Signals**

* Accuracy
* Time per question
* Total time
* Option switching
* Click count
* Attempt count
* User explanation text

### **Analytics Format**

* Stored as structured JSON
* Mapped to:

  * User ID
  * Domain
  * Course
  * Module
  * Concept

---

## **9. Revision Recommendation Engine**

### **Inputs**

* Quiz performance
* Accuracy decay
* Time since last interaction

### **Logic Output**

* Revise now
* Revise soon (1–2 days)
* Revise later (within a week)

This logic simulates **spaced repetition behavior** without ML complexity.

---

## **10. API Design (Simplified)**

### **Key Endpoints**

* `POST /auth/login`
* `GET /domains`
* `POST /diagnostic/submit`
* `GET /roadmap/:userId/:domain`
* `POST /module/quiz/submit`
* `GET /analytics/:userId`
* `GET /revision-planner/:userId`

---

## **11. Deployment Strategy (Hackathon-Friendly)**

### **Frontend**

* **Vercel / Netlify**

  * Instant CI/CD
  * Preview URLs for judges

### **Backend**

* **Render / Railway**

  * Simple Node.js deployment
  * Environment variable support

### **Database & Auth**

* **MongoDB Atlas (Managed)**
* **Supabase Auth (OAuth only)**

---

## **12. Security & Ethical Considerations**

* OAuth-based authentication
* No sensitive personal data stored
* Analytics tied only to User ID
* No punitive scoring or dark patterns

---

## **13. Scalability Considerations**

* Domain-agnostic data models
* JSON-based analytics allow schema evolution
* AI logic layer can later be replaced with ML models
* UI supports unlimited domains

---

## **14. Why This Tech Stack Wins Hackathons**

* Clean separation of concerns
* Demonstrates real AI system thinking
* Feels production-ready
* Easy to explain to judges
* Easy to extend post-hackathon
